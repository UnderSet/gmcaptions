Funny "reimplementation" in GLua of Garry's Mod's caption rendering. (Mostly inspired by *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II*.)

## Features
- Line wrapping
- Colors
- Tag handling
  - Unimplemented: Italic, Bold, `norepeat`, `duration`
- Bottom-aligned and upward-pushing, whatever that stuff's called
- Gradual vertical position adjustment for less jarring visuals when new lines come in
